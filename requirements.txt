1.  malloc():
    implement three strategies: Best Fit, First Fit, and Next Fit.
    ensuring compliance with alignment requirements
2.  free():
    Deallocates the memory block pointed to by ptr, making it available for future allocations. 
    Implementation of the free function should support the merging of adjacent free blocks, reducing fragmentation.
3.  realloc()
4.  calloc()
5.  Testing
