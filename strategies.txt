1. Efficient Memory Allocation Techniques

    Use segregated free lists: Maintain separate free lists for different size classes of allocations. This avoids searching through unrelated memory blocks and improves allocation speed.

    Binning by size: Divide memory into bins of fixed-size blocks. Requests are rounded up to the nearest bin size, reducing fragmentation and allocation overhead.

--> Buddy allocation system: Divide memory into powers-of-two-sized blocks. This allows for efficient splitting and coalescing of memory, reducing fragmentation.

    Slab allocation: Use fixed-size memory blocks for frequently requested object sizes. This is particularly useful for objects with predictable or uniform sizes, like objects in a cache.

2. Fragmentation Mitigation

    Address alignment: Align memory allocations to power-of-two boundaries. This reduces fragmentation by ensuring predictable block placement.

    Best-fit or first-fit policies: Experiment with different allocation policies (e.g., best-fit, first-fit, next-fit) to minimize fragmentation. Each policy has trade-offs between speed and fragmentation.

    Deferred coalescing: Delay merging of adjacent free blocks until necessary (e.g., during larger allocations) to reduce overhead during frequent allocation/free operations.


5. Cache Optimization

    Optimize for locality: Allocate memory blocks close together to improve spatial locality, which can enhance cache performance.

    Minimize false sharing: Align allocations to cache-line boundaries to reduce cache contention in multithreaded applications.

    Hot/cold splitting: Separate frequently accessed (hot) and infrequently accessed (cold) memory regions to improve CPU cache performance.

7. Metadata Management

    Inline metadata storage: Store metadata (e.g., block size, free/allocated status) inline with memory blocks to reduce external storage overhead.

 --> Compact metadata representation: Use efficient data structures (e.g., bitmaps, headers, or boundary tags) to minimize the memory overhead for bookkeeping.

 --> Alignment-aware metadata: Ensure metadata structures respect alignment requirements to avoid wasting memory or introducing fragmentation.
